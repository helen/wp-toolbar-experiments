# WP Toolbar Experiments

This is a plugin to facilitate testing of various potential UX changes to the WordPress toolbar. It is not meant to be a plugin that is distributed and in use unless specifically being tested.

Some ideas include:

* Auditing the current contents to ensure we are including what is most useful for the majority.
* Including the complete admin menu as a dropdown.
* Adding [jQuery Menu Aim](https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim) for better interaction with flyouts.
* Investigating better touch interaction.
* A closer look at the HTML/CSS.
